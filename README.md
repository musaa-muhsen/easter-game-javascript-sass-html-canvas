# easter-game-javascript-sass-html-canvas

Screenshots of a game for a test task based around cadburys. I choose to make a game using HTML5 Canvas element for the task to explore this particular technology as well as using JavaScript for the canvas visual content, animation and interactivity and Sass for other visual content. The game is mobile friendly.
